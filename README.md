## Installation

You can clone from this repository and use master

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/crazyfactory/ts-react-boilerplate
$ cd ts-react-boilerplate
$ npm install
```

## Usage

All commands defaults to development environment. You can set `NODE_ENV` to `production` or use the shortcuts below.

```bash
# Running

$ npm start # This starts the app in development mode

# Starting it with the production build
$ NODE_ENV=production npm start # or
$ npm run start:prod

# Building 

$ npm build # This builds the app in development mode

# Commands below builds the production build
$ NODE_ENV=production npm build # or
$ npm run build:prod

# Testing
$ npm test
```

For Windows users, we recommend using the shortcuts instead of setting environment variables because they work a little different on Windows.
